          <p>Once upon a time there was an old mother pig who had three little pigs and not enough food to feed them.
            So when they were old enough, she sent them out into the world to seek their fortunes.</p>

            <p>The first little pig was very lazy. He didn't want to work at all and he built his house out of straw.</p>

            <p>The second little pig worked a little bit harder but he was somewhat lazy too and he built his house out of sticks.
            Then, they sang and danced and played together the rest of the day.</p>

              <p>The third little pig worked hard all day and built his house with bricks. It was a sturdy house complete with a
                fine fireplace and chimney. It looked like it could withstand the strongest winds.
                The next day, a wolf happened to pass by the lane where the three little pigs lived; </p>

                A wolf comes across a straw house where a first pig is hiding. The wolf wants to eat the pig and knocks on the door, but the pig refuses to let him in. 
                The wolf threatens to blow the house down, and with a huff and a puff, he succeeds. However, the pig manages to escape and runs away to hide with 
                the second pig.

                  The wolf comes across a second house made of sticks where two pigs are hiding. The wolf desires to eat them and knocks on the door, but the pigs refuse 
                  to let him in. The wolf threatens to blow the house down, and with a huff and a puff, he succeeds again. However, when he tries to catch both pigs at once, 
                  he fails because of his greed. The pigs manage to escape and run away as fast as they can.

                  The wolf chases the two pigs to the brick house, where they manage to close the door before he can catch them. The pigs are frightened because they know 
                  the wolf wants to eat them, and the wolf is indeed hungry and can smell them inside. The wolf tries to persuade the pigs to let him in, but they refuse through the keyhole.

                  <p> The wolf threatens to blow the house down but fails despite his huffing and puffing.Exhausted, the wolf takes a break to rest and think of another plan.
                    The wolf danced about with rage and swore he would come down the chimney and eat up the little pig for his supper.

                  <p> But while he was climbing on to 
                    the roof the little pig made up a blazing fire and put on a big pot full of water to boil. Then, just as the wolf was coming down the chimney, the 
                    little piggy pulled off the lid, and plop! in fell the wolf into the scalding water.So the little piggy put on the cover again, boiled the wolf up, 
                    and the three little pigs ate him for supper.THE END!!</p>
